# CourseProjects
This repo contains some of my past course projects that were coded in Python.

Projects

Check Digits
Strings of digits are used in product UPC codes, social insurance numbers, book ISBN numbers, even credit card numbers.  The last number in each of these sequences is called a check digit and is used to verify that the rest of the number is valid. This project creates a Python application that will verify whether 12-digit UPC and 10-digit ISBN numbers are valid or not.
Files:
mainCheckdigits.py - This holds the main function and the menu function.
checkdigits.py - This holds three functions named get_digit, is_UPC12 and is_ISBN10. It is imported into the main file and used to verify whether the codes are valid or not.

A Beautiful Day - Animation
This project is a short 1 minute animation using pygame.
Files:
A Beautiful Day.py - This file holds python program containing the code for the animation.
